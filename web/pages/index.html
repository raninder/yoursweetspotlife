        <h1>Portal Tree Chronicles</h1>
        <p>
            "The Portal Tree Chronicles" is a multi-generational meta-narrative saga featuring a time-traveling prince who discovers a
            community in Ocean Falls, British Columbia. The project encompasses various storytelling forms such as dinner theater, street theater
            performances, augmented reality games, and graphic novels. Each of the 11 seasons focuses on different characters, with nine episodes per season.
            The project aims to showcase live on-location sketches at an annual artisan festival and airs a Christmas episode each year. The timeline spans from September 2024
            to May 2035, with ongoing activities including the annual Artisan Festival and Christmas Eve specials.</p>

        <h1>Classic Reworks</h1>
        <p>
            Classic Reworks is an innovative and thought-provoking initiative that aims to revisit beloved classics
            through a lens of inclusivity, cultural sensitivity, and social awareness. Recognizing that certain classics
            may carry problematic mindsets rooted in racism, discrimination, or cultural assumptions, our mission
            is to reexamine these narratives and engage in meaningful dialogue with the communities or
            individuals who created them. By doing so, we seek to foster a more inclusive and nuanced
            understanding of these stories, addressing the troubling issues and presenting alternative
            perspectives. Classic Reworks is committed to promoting diversity, challenging stereotypes, and
            contributing to a cultural landscape that reflects the richness and complexity of the human
            experience.

            S.T.A.R.T. (Systematic Training and Restoration Team) is our unique program aimed at helping both businesses and individuals. It focuses on two main areas: improving work and personal skills through Systematic Training, and supporting mental health and well-being under Restoration. The idea is to work together as a team (the "T" in S.T.A.R.T.) to learn and grow. We specifically help professionals who are struggling by offering ongoing support, like mentorship and counseling, and making sure they keep making progress. Our goal is to help everyone find and follow their true purpose, making sure their work and personal life reflect what they truly value and aim for, offering solutions that last.

        <h1>Assess</h1>
        <p>
            At the start of our consulting process, we begin with a detailed review to understand our client's current situation. We look closely at what they're doing well, where they can improve, areas for growth, and potential challenges. This step helps us get a clear picture of where the client stands. Our goal is to gather important information that will help guide us through the rest of our work together, making sure we offer solutions that are specifically designed to meet their needs and help them succeed.

    <div class = "content" id = "start-content-3-opened">
        <h1>Plan</h1>
        <p>
            After the initial assessment, the consulting journey progresses to the planning stage. In this phase, we develop a strategic plan that is carefully designed using the insights gathered during the assessment. This plan includes clear, measurable goals and objectives, as well as the steps needed to reach these targets. The planning phase acts as the guiding framework for the entire consulting process, setting the path for achieving the outcomes we aim for.

    <div class = "content" id = "start-content-4-opened">
        <h1>Learn</h1>
        <p>
            Once the strategic plan is established, we move into the learning phase of the consulting process. This phase focuses on putting the plan into action through different learning initiatives, such as workshops, training sessions, or educational materials. The aim here is to provide individuals with the essential knowledge and skills they need to effectively carry out the strategic plan

    <div class = "content" id = "start-content-5-opened">
        <h1>Grow</h1>
        <p>
            Following the learning phase, we enter the growth stage of the consulting process. This stage is all about observing and encouraging both personal and professional growth. We use key performance indicators (KPIs) to track progress, making sure that everyone involved is improving in their skills, competencies, and general performance.

    <div class = "content" id = "start-content-6-opened">
        <h1>Create</h1>
        <p>
            The consulting process culminates in the creation phase. At this point, participants use the knowledge and skills they've gained to produce concrete results. This may include creating solutions, introducing innovations, or reaching the specific goals set out in the original strategic plan. The creation phase signifies the end of the consulting journey, showcasing the real-world effects and achievements of the process.
